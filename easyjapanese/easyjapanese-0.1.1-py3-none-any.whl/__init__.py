"""Let's study Easy Japanese (やさしいにほんご) daily with NHK news web easy!

This module (package) mainly covers the topics listed below.
- To get the URLs of the easy Japanese news articles (easy.py)
- To extract the body texts of them (easy.py)
- To get the URL of the original articles of them (regular.py)
- To extract the original ones as well (regular.py)
- To concatenate all the above data (complete.py)
- To save them all as a csv file (complete.py)

I do not own any rights for the articles, nor take any responsibility caused 
by the use of this module. 

Have a great Easy Japanese (やさしいにほんご) life!
