class HEAObject(abc.ABC):
    """
    Interface for all HEA objects. HEA objects are data transfer objects for moving data between HEA microservices as
    well as between a HEA microservice and a web browser or other client. HEA objects have no behavior except support
    for storage, retrieval, serialization, and deserialization. The AbstractHEAObject class provides default
    implementations for setting and getting attributes, as well as default implementations of behaviors.

    There are two sub-types of HEA objects: desktop objects (DesktopObject) and owned
    objects (MemberObject). The AbstractDesktopObject and AbstractMemberObject classes provide default implementations
    for setting and getting attributes, and default implementations of behaviors. There may be additional sub-types in
    the future.

    Desktop objects represent objects that appear on the HEA desktop. Desktop objects have permissions, timestamps for
    when the object was created and modified, versions, and more. One or more HEA microservices provide CRUD (create,
    read, update, and delete) operations on each desktop object type. Additional HEA microservices may implement actions
    that consume or produce specific desktop object types.

    Member objects cannot appear by themselves on the HEA desktop. Instead, they have a part-of relationship with a
    desktop object, and their lifecycle is managed by the desktop object. Example member objects represent permissions
    and data sharing. While owned objects provide for their own storage, retrieval, serialization, and deserialization,
    these behaviors are always invoked by the desktop object of which they are a part. HEA objects may contain only one
    level of nested members.

    HEA objects must conform to several conventions to ease their use and reuse across the HEA desktop.
    All subclasses of HEAObject must have a zero-argument constructor. Attribute values may be strings, numbers, booleans,
    enums, or a HEA object; or a list of strings, numbers, booleans, enums, or HEA objects. Attributes of type enum
    must be implemented as a property with a setter that accepts both strings and the enum values, and will convert the
    strings to enum values.

    In general, HEA objects implement composition relationships by making the container a desktop object and the "owned"
    object a member object. Other association relationships are implemented by storing the id of the associated object
    rather than nesting it. By convention, the id attributes are named hea_object_class_name_id, where hea_object_class_name
    is the name of the class converted from camel case to underscores. There is one exception to this convention in the
    heaobject library. Item objects contain a nested copy of the desktop object that they refer to.

    Copies and deep copies using the copy module will copy all non-callable instance members of any subclass of HEAObject.

    In addition, HEA objects should include type annotations throughout.

    It is imperative that users gain access to desktop objects by calling an appropriate HEA microservice as themselves, which
    will filter any nested member objects that are returned according to their permissions.

    """
    Interface for objects that can appear on the HEA desktop. Desktop objects have permissions, with those permissions
    represented by owned objects implementing the MemberObject interface. Other attributes may also employ owned
    objects. One or more HEA microservices provide CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations on each desktop
    object type. Additional HEA microservices may implement actions that use specific desktop object types.

    Desktop objects implement no capability to check the current user when getting and setting owned objects, and
    different users may only have access to a subset of its owned objects. Similarly, owned objects have no knowledge of
    permissions at all. It is imperative that users gain access to desktop objects by calling an appropriate HEA
    microservice as themselves, which will filter the owned objects that are returned according to their permissions.

    Desktop objects may employ three authorization mechanisms:

    1) User-based: if the user is the object's owner, then the user can do anything with the object.
    2) Shares-based: if the owner has shared the object with a user, then the user can use the object according to the
    values of the heaobject.root.Permission enum.
    3) Dynamic permissions: Implemented using the dynamic_permission function, it uses the object's field values to
    determine the user's permissions. It will only be invoked if the user has some level of shares-based permission. In
    the absence of the object actually having been shared with a user, a Share object can be added to the shares list
    with user system|all and the minimum permission level (CHECK_DYNAMIC). In the future, it may be possible to
    traverse relationships between objects via their *_id fields so that related objects' field values might be used to
    determine permissions.

    The level of permissions granted will be the greatest of the 3 approaches. Being an object's owner trumps
    everything. The shares-based and dynamic permissions-based approaches both return heaobject.root.Permission objects,
    and in the event of conflicting Permissions, the most permissive permissions will prevail.

    Desktop objects may have a class variable, associations, with type Dict[property, str]. For properties ending in
    _id or _ids that represent an association relationship with another desktop object type, it defines the type name
    of the desktop object being referred to. The associations variable is intended to have many purposes. In the future,
    implementations of the dynamic_permission() method might use these annotations to traverse an association
    relationship to another desktop object as part of permissions checking.

    except support for storage, retrieval, serialization, and deserialization. The AbstractHEAObject class provides
    default implementations for setting and getting attributes, as well as default implementations of behaviors.

    There are two sub-types of HEA objects: desktop objects (DesktopObject) and owned
    objects (MemberObject). The AbstractDesktopObject and AbstractMemberObject classes provide default implementations
    for setting and getting attributes, and default implementations of behaviors. There may be additional sub-types in
    the future.

    HEA object implementations must conform to several conventions to ease their use and reuse across the HEA desktop.
    All subclasses of HEAObject must have a zero-argument constructor. All non-callable instance members must be
    included in the to_dict() and json_dumps() methods. Copies and deep copies using the copy module will copy all
    non-callable instance members of any subclass of HEAObject. Override __copy__ and __deepcopy__ to change that
    behavior. In addition, HEA objects should include type annotations for all properties and callables.

    Desktop objects implement no capability to check the current user when getting and setting owned objects, and
    different users may only have access to a subset of its owned objects. Similarly, owned objects have no knowledge of
    permissions at all. It is imperative that users gain access to desktop objects by calling an appropriate HEA
    microservice as themselves, which will filter the owned objects that are returned according to their permissions.
