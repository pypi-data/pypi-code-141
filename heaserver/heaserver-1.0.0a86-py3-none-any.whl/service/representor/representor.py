        processed, and are replaced with their values by this method. Nested JSON objects are referred to using dot

        be None.

        wstl_obj. Links can be specific to a data item in the wstl_obj's data list or "global" to the entire data list.
        The first parameter contains the index of the data item, or None if the link is global. The second
        parameter contains the link as a heaserver.service.representor.Link object. The purpose of this
        callback is to access parameterized links after their parameters have been filled in.
